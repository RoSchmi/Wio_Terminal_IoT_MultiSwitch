# Wio_Terminal_IoT_MultiSwitch

Control digital Inputs and Outputs of Wio Terminal using Sinric Pro service and phone-App via SinricPro_Generic library.

#### Unfortunately the Wio Terminal App occasionally hangs. So for a real live use case a watchdog would be needed.

Functions can be used as Alexa-skills.
